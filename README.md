Getting Started with QGIS
=========================
This workshop is designed to help users who are new to QGIS to find their way around, and to understand some of its main features. It doesn't assume an understanding of GIS, though if you are familiar with GIS you'll be able to move through much quicker. Everything you need for the workshop, including source data, is included or linked. The workshop will probably take about 2 hours to run through, though that will of course vary a lot according to your starting knowledge.

If you have any comments or corrections on the workshop, please raise an issue on the [github repository](https://github.com/antonys/qgis-workshop) for the workshop.
